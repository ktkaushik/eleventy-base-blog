## What is an incident?

> We define incident as the background cause for every issue that your customer could face. This includes __spike__ in your frontend errors, issues in application, infrastructure problems, etc. 

## How it works?

We integrate easily with most of the tools you use.

1. __Add all your (micro)services__. Ex: Notification service, Cron service, API serivce, Dashboard service.
1. __Setup one or more integrations for every service__. Ex: UptimeRobot, HealthChecks, AWS, Google Cloud, Sentry, etc.
1. __Start receiving alerts__. Choose your own channel. Phone, email, slack etc.

_We offer unlimited services, integrations and alerts_

## Benefits

We will try not to use generic terms here -

1. __Alerts__ - You and your team will immediately stay on top of any issues across your platform, this thanks to our alerts via escalation policies. Never let go a single incident outside your radar.
1. __Resolve time__ - The sooner you learn about these incidents, the sooner you resolve so lesser customers are affected or in many cases you avoid breaking SLAs
1. __Integrations__ - All the spikes under one platform. A spike in error, spike in memory usage etc
1. __Reports__ - You can get a blueprint of the exact health of your platform. This is crucial. Overtime, you can compare the number of incidents each of your service receives.
1. __Transparency__ - Spike helps bring in transparency amongst your team and helps make sense of how a single incident could start affecting one or more services.
1. __Preparation__ - Spike helps your team build a culture of resolving issues in time. When something crucial hits, you and your team can go all hands on deck to resolve the most pressing issue.
1. __Confidence__ - As resolve time gets better, your customers will gain more confidence in your platform. A strong engineering culture leads the way with Spike.
