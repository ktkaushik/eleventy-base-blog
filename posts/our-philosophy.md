At Spike, our core values are - 

1. __Honesty__
2. __Simplicity__
3. __Focus__
4. __Happiness__

## Honesty

As of August 2019, we are now to this space. Very new actually. We are getting things up and running and building small set of features for a small set of customers and this is important. These customers took a chance on us and wWe are very thankful to each and every one of them. __Honesty__ to us lies at the center of what we do and how we operate. We believe in keeping it honest not just with each other but also with out customers.

## Simplicity

Solving a problem means creating new ones too. We want to ensure that you don't need to jump a hundred hooplas to get things done. You pay for a product to do a job for you in an unobstructive and smooth manner. That's what we do. We've built Spike with __Simplicity__ at it's core. Quick reports, boom! Instant alerts, yes please.

## Focus

Our primary focus is to build a great product. If Spike could help you from breaking SLA contracts or increase your customer confidence then we have done our job. To achieve this, we don't want to get sidelined by all things new and shiny. We choose to __Focus__ on things that matter and are important.

## Happiness

Customer Satisfaction is not a metric we want to take lightly. Ever. Our life experience teaches us to value existing customers at all times. Our customer support team will always be available on the chat widget inside the dashboard, or on email at [support@spike.sh](mailto:support@spike.sh). On twitter, you can reach out to us at [@SpikedHQ](https://twitter.com/spikedhq). You can also reach out to me, Founder of Spike on twitter at [@ktkaushik](https://twitter.com/ktkaushik).


We believe that to make a successful product, you need ~lot of funding~ all the above values and the tenacity to stick with it.
